1. I find some problems in defining my frontend structure

Ở luồng FE, có 3 loại user: Unauthenticated, Authenticated và Admin. Admin sẽ được chuyển qua /admin ngay sau khi đăng nhập. Còn Unauthenticated thì sẽ k truy
cập tài nguyên của Authenticated được. Chỉ khi nào Authenticate thì mới đăng nhập

Một vài vấn đề khi xử lý với authenticated / unauthenticated:
1. Header đổi khác cho authenticated / unauthenticated nên khó xử lý
2. Admin chỉ có thể đăng nhập qua google. Sẽ redirect response sang /. Như vậy thì mới response được redirect, còn front vẫn phải xử lý redirect trên client.
3. Ưu tiên làm luồng FE CRUD trước, để dễ xử lý thông tin.

0. Viết tất cả các API service vào cùng 1 file
1. Viết lại useAuth (custom hook) để check authentication
2. Viết Routes và protected route
Routes cho các path đầu (level cao nhất):
Unauthenticated
/
/get-random-quote
/login
/signup
Authenticated
/quote-gallery
/daily-email-signup
/account
/favorites
/change-password
/delete-account
Admin
/admin/
/admin/quotes
/admin/quoteSequences
/admin/users
/admin/tags
/admin/survey-tickets

bug #1: skill issues:
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/hooks/useAuthAuthenticated.jsx' does not provide an export named 'useAuthAuthenticated' (at ProtectedRoutesAuthenticated.jsx:2:10)
???

export default useAuthAuthenticated;
So, when importing it, you should import it without curly braces, as it's a default export. Here's the correct way to import it:
import useAuthAuthenticated from "../hooks/useAuthAuthenticated"; // No curly braces needed for default export

Written 2 hooks, 1 for admin authentication protected route, 1 for admin protected route


# Build form login/signup first, then do what you need to do for admins.

Day 1:
Step when setting up tailwind for project
1. By default, tailwindcss has PREFLIGHT. Add it in main.jsx
2. Setting bases font-size, line-height, font-family
3. Setting up primary for light and dark modes in tailwind.config

Day 2:
1. build dashboard ui using grid 
2. Build the home page of admin
Day 3:
1. Finish the admin dashboard page
2. Finish the searching options for admins: normal text, tags, date, sequence types, time in hours
State, data lifting

There one problem:
I need to use React to do CRUD operations. But the catch is: 
If I were to do it manually
- After add, update, delete, the data should be updated in the UI.
- If I were to make API calls on each of that, then there would be a lot of api calls. 
=> After load => calls to render data => After add => calls to render data => After delete => call to render data => Typing in search input => call to render data

There should be a better way to do this. 

Nah it just your logic is flawed

Day 4:
I have both debounce value and input value. Debounce value was there to make it so that it wont call api everytime you typed in.
I forgot to reset debounce value, only reset input value. Which lead to a frustrating bug :(

Q: What's postcss?

Oddly logical question. If TextInput is the same as Input type = text, then why are you creating a seperate component???? Same thing with all other input types....

For now, timezone is being used as a textInput due tot he fact that I cant change timezone atm

And I adopt redux to manage states

onClick={() => setSubmit(true)}
is different to
onClick={setSubmit(true)}

I should know what a normal select can do, BEFORE building a custom select.

Bug:

Age
A, g, e, Business
A, ,,  , g, ,,  , e, ,,  , B, u, s, i, n, e, s, s, Character

Cause by this line:
useEffect(() => {
    console.log(value)
    setTags(value);
}, [value]);

Took me 3 hours to think of a workaround. Took me just 10 minutes to solve the problem when not think of a workaround. value need a default ""; and don't pass in 
inputValue when searching

^^ IMPORTANT ^^
in forms, any button that doesn't declared its type is defaulted to submit....
^^ IMPORTANT ^^

Handle tags CRUD and Users CRUD 

There's no error handling on frontend when receiving error

You learnt something

If you pass in an array in useEffect dependency, it gonna cause a loop to happen.

=> so the workaround is to JSON.stringify the array
=> Clever, right?

Importing svg is a bit different than usual html

import XIcon from "../../../assets/HamburgerMenuClose_icon.svg";
<Menu customBurgerIcon={<img src={HamburgerIcon} alt="Menu Icon" />}>

Why don't I use variable to store the hard coded value in this?

  useEffect(() => {
    if (error) {
      setShowErrorToast(true);

      // Automatically hide the toast after 5 seconds
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        setShowErrorToast(false);
        dispatch(resetError()); // Reset the success state after showing the toast
      }, 3000);

      // Cleanup timer
      return () => clearTimeout(timer);
    }
  }, [error, dispatch]);

Reason: Toast has its own functionality implemented, which also has a setTimeout. And that's kind of bad for a custom component

30/11: Trying to implement shadcn on javascript, making use of this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXSC5eMw68o

Implementing it simply just by creating a new jsconfig.json, then paste this in:

{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        "@/*": ["./src/*"]
      }
    }
  }

Also shadcn does override some stuff in tailwind.config.js. In my case it was 
darkMode: ["class"] >> darkMode: ["class", "class"]

Changed it back
