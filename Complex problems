This is, to me, complex things that I tried to solve when building this project

1. How to build a system where user when requesting for random quote everyday, they got their own set of random quote (not the same quotes sequence as others)

2. How to build a system so that the get random quote functionality invoked when user click on 
(get another quote button), it will fetch another quote to the UI.
    Either:Fetch each quote everytime user click onto the button?
    Or: Should I save 100 random quotes onto client memory? After all 100 quotes is scrolled, I'll make another request to get another 100 randomly?

3. How to write code so that in every hour cronjob is running, it's getting send to user with the specified (auto detect timezone) Or manually updated timezone
(this one is a rabbit hole in itself. So, before you do anything, research is a must)
(But this one worth alot of points, and you can save 1 way to handle this one and for all)
<=> I give up
