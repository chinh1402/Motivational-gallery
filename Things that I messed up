1. I didn't specify the data type when using postman (cant send using text, must be JSON)
2. I downloaded node packages outside of the folders
3. Outdated information cause chatgpt. Logout now need a callback (which need to be fed from documentation)
4. code: 'EAI_AGAIN', read /backend/onlyuseonce/fetchQuote.js; Solution: use VPN
5. route.js:216
        throw new Error(msg);
        ^

Error: Route.post() requires a callback function but got a [object Undefined]  

I commented the API controller, but I didn't commented the route.

6. Problems about .random: The program will be slower the more items it gotta sorted out (random can hit the very value that was used, and it kept on doing that)

7. Type of Quotes and Type of UsedQuotes aren't compatible to override
=> Made a workaround by re-making the models

8. Error fetching quotes: MongooseError: Operation `quotes.insertMany()` buffering timed out after 10000ms
=> Didn't connected to database

9. Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted.

Google disabled less secure apps now so you need to setup Login with app password In summary you must setup your access with two factor authentication in order to allow the app password

transport: {
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  auth: {
    user: 'contact@gmail.com',
    pass: 'app password',
  },
},

And no, even with unidentified email, you can still send the email

Ofcourse, only the users signed up (in quote sequence) can use the services

10. Giving alias to email name:
...
const mailOptions = {
    from: `Motivation Quote <${process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL}>`,
    to,
    subject,
    text
  };
...

11. Giving wrong object field name when sending postman POST request
- loginusernameoremail 
- loginUsernameOrEmail
Are two different things

12. Cant add object directly into a schema. You gotta make a new schema then require it in another schema

13. Can you compare query, body, param?

14. For some reason, you gotta cd to /utils/onlyuseonce to access .env... when running fetchQuotev2. dunno why

15. Set html for email sending so that it send html (instead of text)

16. So, whatever path you're standing at, It need to has the files that you're importing in for the code you're running. Im standing at 
/backend/utils/onlyuseonce. It cant find the file with the name of /backend/.env        Opposite to 14.

17. The old change password is:
User type in their old password and new password. But you gotta verify using email afterward. => Result in you gotta save new password somewhere
But if you do that, you gotta hash it again.. But in user.js there's an auto password hashing function

=> So in short, should have accounted for the fact that password handling need to be taken more seriously

18. My site login logout cookie is shit
- It only saves cookie in one browser session. If that browser closes, user gotta log in again! :(

NEVERMIND it does!
:>

I still don't understand shits


19. On frontend, when you do withCredential: true. It must be the 3rd params
